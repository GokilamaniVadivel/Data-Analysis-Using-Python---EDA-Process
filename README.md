# Data-Analysis-Using-Python---EDA-Process

This project focuses on conducting a thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python on a Marvel character dataset titled marvel (1) (1).csv. The dataset includes various attributes such as character names, gender, alignment (good, bad, neutral), number of comic book appearances, and the year each character first appeared. It serves as a rich source for analyzing trends and patterns in the Marvel Universe.

The EDA process begins with loading and understanding the structure of the dataset. Initial steps include data cleaning such as handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing duplicates. Once the data is preprocessed, the analysis dives into exploring different features individually and in relation to each other.

Visualization plays a key role in this analysis. Using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, several types of graphs and charts are createdâ€”bar charts to show gender distribution, pie charts for alignment, line plots to track character introductions over the years, and heatmaps to reveal correlations between numerical features.

One of the main goals of this project is to discover meaningful insights. For example, the analysis shows whether most characters are good, bad, or neutral, which gender appears more frequently, and which years saw the most character introductions. It also identifies characters with the highest number of appearances and visualizes their significance in the dataset.

Overall, this EDA provides a deep understanding of the Marvel Universe from a data perspective. It showcases how data science techniques can be applied to entertainment-related datasets for storytelling, trend discovery, and fun visualizations
